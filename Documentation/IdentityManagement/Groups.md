# Groups

Using the groups pages you can easily edit groups and add users to groups, you can also create new groups.
# Current known issues / Limitations

Groups currently do not return all data such as external senders, and not all settings can be set by partners. Microsoft is aware and will fix this in a new release of the Graph API.
